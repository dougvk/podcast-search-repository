## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
1. **Memvid Complexity** (Medium Risk)
   - Impact: Could delay foundation by 2-3 days
   - Mitigation: Start with simple prototype, build complexity gradually
   - Status: Being monitored

2. **Dependency Conflicts** (Low Risk)
   - Impact: Could require alternative package versions
   - Mitigation: Test in clean environment, document all versions
   - Status: Not encountered yet

### Mitigation Actions
- Create simple text-to-video prototype before full integration
- Test all dependencies in isolated environment
- Have fallback storage approach ready if memvid integration fails

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Python 3.9+ runtime environment
- OpenCV for video processing
- Docker for containerization
- Git access to memvid repository

### Internal Dependencies
- None (this is the foundation stage)

## Deliverables

### Primary Deliverables
- [ ] **Complete Python Environment**
  - Virtual environment with all dependencies
  - Docker configuration for dev/prod
  - Environment variable management

- [ ] **Core Module Framework**
  - Python package structure
  - Configuration management system
  - Logging and error handling

- [ ] **Memvid Integration**
  - Adapted video encoding/decoding
  - Text chunk processing
  - Metadata preservation system

### Documentation Deliverables
- [x] **Project Structure** - Complete directory layout
- [x] **Architecture Documentation** - Technical design decisions
- [x] **Implementation Plan** - Detailed stage breakdown
- [x] **Progress Tracking** - Status monitoring system

## Quality Gates

### Stage 1 Exit Criteria
- [ ] All unit tests pass for core modules
- [ ] Docker environment builds without errors
- [ ] Basic video encoding/decoding demonstrates >100:1 compression
- [ ] Configuration system handles all required settings
- [ ] Error handling provides actionable feedback

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] Integration tests for video encoding/decoding
- [ ] Configuration validation tests
- [ ] Docker container health checks

## Resource Allocation

### Time Allocation
- **Environment Setup:** 10 hours (36%)
- **Core Module Structure:** 11 hours (39%)
- **Memvid Integration:** 28 hours (25%)
- **Total Estimated:** 49 hours

### Critical Path
Environment Setup → Core Module Structure → Memvid Integration

## Issues and Blockers

### Current Issues
- None reported

### Resolved Issues
- None yet (stage just started)

### Escalation Process
- Minor issues: Document and continue
- Major blockers: Escalate immediately with fallback plan
- Timeline risks: Adjust scope or extend timeline

## Communication

### Daily Standup Updates
- Progress on current tasks
- Any blockers encountered
- Plan for next day

### Stage Completion Review
