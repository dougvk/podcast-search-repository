## Current Focus

### Today's Priorities (June 15, 2025)
1. **Complete Configuration System** - Create YAML config files for embeddings, chunking, and search
2. **Set Up Python Environment** - Create requirements.txt and virtual environment
3. **Initialize Module Structure** - Add __init__.py files and basic imports
4. **Begin Memvid Analysis** - Research and understand memvid codebase for adaptation

### This Week's Goals
- Complete all Stage 1 foundation tasks
- Have working Python environment with all dependencies
- Successfully encode/decode text using adapted memvid functionality
- Begin Stage 2 transcript processing development

## Key Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Search Speed Target:** < 1 second ‚úÖ (Architecture designed for this)
- **Storage Efficiency Target:** < 5MB per episode ‚úÖ (Video encoding should achieve this)
- **Cost Target:** < $10 total ‚úÖ (Local deployment keeps costs minimal)
- **Accuracy Target:** 95%+ relevance ‚è≥ (To be tested in Stage 3)

### Technical Debt
- **Documentation Coverage:** 100% ‚úÖ (PRD, Architecture, Implementation Plan complete)
- **Code Coverage:** 0% ‚è≥ (No code written yet)
- **Configuration Management:** 50% üü° (Structure planned, files not created)
- **Error Handling:** 0% ‚è≥ (To be implemented)

## Blockers and Risks

### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### Active Risks
1. **Memvid Integration Complexity** (Medium Risk)
   - **Status:** Being monitored
   - **Mitigation:** Plan to create simple prototype first
   - **Fallback:** Alternative text storage approaches prepared

2. **Search Quality for Conversational Content** (Medium Risk)
   - **Status:** Not yet encountered
   - **Mitigation:** Multiple embedding models will be tested
   - **Fallback:** Hybrid semantic + keyword search planned

### Resolved Issues
- **Project Structure Uncertainty** - Resolved with comprehensive documentation
- **Technology Stack Questions** - Resolved with architecture decisions

## Team and Resources

### Development Resources
- **Primary Developer:** 1 person (full-time equivalent)
- **Development Environment:** macOS with Python 3.9+
- **Hardware Requirements:** Standard development machine (sufficient for local testing)
- **External Dependencies:** None (all processing local)

### Budget Status
- **Spent:** $0
- **Allocated:** $10 total
- **Remaining:** $10 (100% available)
- **Primary Costs:** One-time setup only (no recurring costs planned)

## Next Actions

### Immediate Next Steps (Today)
1. Create configuration files (embeddings.yaml, chunking.yaml, search.yaml)
2. Set up requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
3. Create Python package structure with __init__.py files
4. Begin memvid repository analysis and adaptation planning

### This Week (June 15-21)
1. Complete all Stage 1 foundation tasks
2. Create working development environment
3. Implement basic video encoding/decoding prototype
4. Begin Stage 2 transcript processing design

### Next Week (June 22-28)
1. Complete transcript processing pipeline
2. Implement batch processing for large datasets
3. Begin search infrastructure development
4. Test with sample podcast episodes
