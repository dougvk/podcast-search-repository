# Podcast Search Repository - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current Challenge
- 700+ transcribed podcast episodes contain valuable information but are difficult to search and analyze
- No efficient way to find specific topics, quotes, or insights across all episodes
- Traditional text search is inadequate for conversational content
- Need cost-effective solution that scales beyond 700 episodes

### Business Impact
- Lost productivity searching through transcripts manually
- Missed opportunities to reference relevant past discussions
- Inability to create cross-episode insights and connections
- Difficulty in content research and preparation

## 2. Solution Overview

Build an AI-powered, semantically searchable repository using video-encoded storage (based on memvid) that enables:
- Sub-second search across all 700 episodes
- Semantic understanding of conversational content
- Cost-effective storage and retrieval
- Easy integration with AI tools and workflows

## 3. Success Metrics

### Performance Requirements
- **Search Speed**: < 1 second response time for any query
- **Search Accuracy**: 95%+ relevance for semantic queries
- **Storage Efficiency**: < 5MB average per episode
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability for search functionality

### Cost Requirements
- **Total Setup Cost**: < $10 (one-time)
- **Monthly Operating Cost**: < $5 (self-hosted)
- **Scalability**: Linear cost scaling for additional episodes

### User Experience
- **Query Complexity**: Support natural language questions
- **Result Quality**: Return relevant context with episode metadata
- **Interface Simplicity**: Single search box with rich results

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Search Capabilities
- **Semantic Search**: Find content by meaning, not just keywords
- **Cross-Episode Discovery**: Identify related topics across different episodes
- **Context Preservation**: Return relevant surrounding conversation
- **Metadata Integration**: Include episode title, date, speakers, timestamps

### 4.2 Content Processing
- **Transcript Ingestion**: Process various transcript formats (txt, srt, json)
- **Speaker Recognition**: Handle multi-speaker conversations
- **Chunking Strategy**: Optimize text segments for conversational content
- **Batch Processing**: Handle 700+ episodes efficiently

### 4.3 Storage & Retrieval
- **Video Encoding**: Use memvid's MP4 storage for compression
- **Index Management**: FAISS-based semantic indexing
- **Incremental Updates**: Add new episodes without full rebuild
- **Backup & Recovery**: Protect against data loss

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- Support concurrent searches from multiple users
- Handle dataset growth to 1000+ episodes
- Maintain search speed as dataset grows

### 5.2 Reliability
- Graceful degradation if individual episodes fail to load
- Error recovery for corrupted video files
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 5.3 Maintainability
- Clear documentation for setup and operation
- Modular architecture for easy updates
- Configuration-driven behavior

### 5.4 Security
- No external API dependencies for core functionality
- Local processing to protect transcript content
- Optional authentication for web interface

## 6. User Stories

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Topic Research**: "Find all discussions about machine learning across all episodes"
2. **Quote Finding**: "Locate the exact quote where [guest] talked about productivity"
3. **Preparation**: "What has been said about [topic] in previous episodes?"
4. **Cross-Reference**: "Find episodes that discuss similar themes to episode #347"

### Secondary Use Cases
1. **Content Creation**: Generate episode summaries and key quotes
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identify frequently discussed topics over time
3. **Guest Preparation**: Review previous appearances and relevant discussions
4. **Research Validation**: Find supporting or contrasting viewpoints

## 7. Technical Constraints

### Infrastructure
- Must run on standard development hardware
- Self-hosted solution preferred for cost control
- Docker-based deployment for consistency

### Data Format
- Support common transcript formats
- Preserve speaker attribution where available
- Handle varying audio quality and transcription accuracy

### Integration
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- Simple web interface for manual searches
- Export capabilities for further analysis

## 8. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- Set up memvid-based architecture
- Create transcript processing pipeline
- Implement basic video encoding storage

### Phase 2: Search Infrastructure (Week 2)
- Deploy FAISS semantic search
- Create API endpoints
- Add metadata handling

### Phase 3: User Interface (Week 3)
- Build web search interface
- Add result ranking and display
- Implement export functionality

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 4)
- Performance tuning and testing
- Documentation and deployment guides
- Batch processing for full 700-episode dataset

## 9. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Embedding Quality**: Conversational content may not embed well
- **Storage Scaling**: Video files may become unwieldy at scale
- **Search Accuracy**: Semantic search may miss nuanced queries

### Mitigation Strategies
- Test with sample episodes before full processing
- Implement configurable chunking strategies
- Provide both semantic and keyword search options
- Regular accuracy testing with known queries

## 10. Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product
- Search across all 700 episodes in < 1 second
- 90%+ accuracy for simple topic queries
- Basic web interface with result display
- Total cost under $10

### Full Success
- 95%+ accuracy for complex semantic queries
- Cross-episode insight generation
- API integration ready
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy deployment and maintenance
